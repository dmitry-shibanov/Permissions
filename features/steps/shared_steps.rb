This means that there is an alert blocking Calabash gestures and that Calabash
failed to auto dismiss the alert.

When testing the Photos alert, it is possible that the animation associated with
dismissing (Cancel) the Photo Roll will cause the two_finger_tap to fail because
the touch happens on the view that is animating off - adjust the sleep.
